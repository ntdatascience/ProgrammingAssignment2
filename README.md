### Overview

These functions provide the ability to cache manage matrixes so that inverse calculations don't need to be recalcualted. Once the inverse is calculated for the object the result is stored in the cache for quick retrieval in the future.

### Functions

    makeCacheMatrix 
by providing a standard R matrix to the makeCacheMatrix an object is returned that allows for caching of inverse solutions. **You must use this routine on your standard R matrix so that it can be cache managed.**

    cacheSolve 
by providing a cache matrix object generated by makeCacheMatrix this routine will either calculate the inverse of the matrix (using the matrix solve method); or, if previously calculated the resulting inverse is returned directly from the cache

**NOTE:** if the inverse of the provided matrix can't be determined your receive an error when calling cacheSolve *"Error in solve.default(data, ...)"*

###How to Use:

1) create a standard R matrix. then use our special makeCacheMatrix function
2) now, perform cacheSolve on the special matrix object
3) run cacheSolve again on the same managed object and see that the cached result is returned
4) show what happens when performing solve on another matrix

```
> m1 <- cbind(1:3,c(5,1,1),c(4,8,14))
> m1_c <- makeCacheMatrix(m1)
> cacheSolve(m1_c)
